### Gear Ratio
- The gears involved have the following teeth counts:
* Green Gear: 5 teeth
* Red Gear: 30 teeth
* Blue Gear: 30 teeth
* Yellow Gear: 10 teeth

- The gear ratio is calculated as follows:
* Total gear ratio: 6/1 * 3/1 = 18 


## Demo 
A demo animation of the gears in motion showing the achieved gear ratio.
